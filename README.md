# -Walmart-E---Commerce-Sales-Metrics-Study

This project aimed to analyze e-commerce sales data from a dataset containing transactional information from an online store. The primary objectives were to evaluate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Average Purchase Value (APV), Total Revenue, Repeat Purchase Rate, Cart Abandonment Rate, and Revenue by different segments (e.g., gender, age group, and city category) in order to uncover patterns and insights that could inform business strategy and decision-making.

Additionally, the project involved A/B testing to assess the impact of a new intervention (simulated checkout process change) on customer purchasing behavior, with the goal of determining whether the intervention would lead to measurable improvements in conversion rates.

Through the analysis, several key findings emerged:

The business demonstrated strong customer retention, with a 100% repeat purchase rate.
Revenue distribution across gender, age group, and city category revealed specific segments driving higher sales, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing and promotional efforts.
A significant cart abandonment rate highlighted an area of opportunity to optimize the checkout process and reduce lost sales.
A/B testing showed no statistically significant impact from the intervention, indicating that the changes did not meaningfully affect purchasing behavior.
The project provided a comprehensive overview of e-commerce performance and offered actionable recommendations for improvement, such as addressing cart abandonment and focusing marketing efforts on high-revenue customer segments. The insights gathered through this analysis serve as a foundation for further optimizing the customer experience and driving business growth.
